- [x] It uses modern JavaScript (for example, let and const rather than var).
- [x] It makes use of the reading and writing to the same file feature.

      enters a wrong input.
- [x] It is styled using your own CSS.
- [x] The code follows the code and style conventions as
      introduced in the course, is fully documented using comments
      and doesn't contain unused or experimental code.
      In particular, the code should not use `print()` or
      `console.log()` for any information the app user should see.
